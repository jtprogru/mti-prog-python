# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Typical development workflow

All code in this repository is a collection of small, self‑contained Python scripts that demonstrate basic language features. There is no build or test harness – scripts are executed directly with the Python interpreter.

### Running the scripts

Each lab is a standalone module containing a `main()` function guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":`. To run a particular script, use:

```bash
python <script>.py
```

Examples:

```bash
python lab1.py
python calculator.py
python anketa.py
```

If you need to provide command‑line arguments, pass them after the script name.

### Working in a virtual environment

A `.venv` directory is included. To activate it (on macOS/Linux):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The virtual environment is set up for Python 3.14 (or the latest compatible interpreter). You can install additional dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` – the repository currently has no external dependencies.

### Linting / formatting

No linting or formatting configuration is present in this repo. If you wish to enforce a style guide, you may add tools such as `flake8` or `black` and create corresponding configuration files.

## High‑level architecture

* **Main entry point** – `main.py` simply prints a greeting and notes that the repository contains separate scripts for demonstration purposes.
* **Lab scripts** – Each file (`lab1.py`, `calculator.py`, `anketa.py`, etc.) contains an isolated example or exercise. They expose a `main()` function and can be run independently.
* **Supporting modules** – The repository includes additional small scripts (`string_operations.py`, `student_grades.py`, `inventory.py`, etc.) that provide small utilities or demonstrations. They follow the same pattern: a `main()` function for interactive use.
* **No shared state** – The scripts are intentionally decoupled; there is no shared database or state across modules.

## Notes for future contributors

* If you add new exercises, follow the existing style: a single script with a `main()` function and a clear `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard.
* Keep the repository lightweight; avoid adding large data files or compiled artifacts.
* The project currently has no tests. If you introduce new functionality, consider adding unit tests under a `tests/` directory and configuring a simple CI workflow.
